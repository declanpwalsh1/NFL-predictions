# NFLGambling by Declan Walsh
NFLGambling Web App with MERN


This web application was remodelled from the senior thesis of Declan Walsh, Patrick Doud, Henry Laurich, and Daniel Tang. I, Declan Walsh, was in
a training program for React.js before it was cancelled due to Covid-19. This project is me using my newfound React knowledge to create a more functional
web application. During this process I also learned Node.js with Express to create the backend web server. I expanded on my previous knowledge of MongoDB and also 
developed skills in Authentication with Javascript packages like Joi and Json Web Tokens.
